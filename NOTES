The idea is to make a proper ssh implementation for Android.  Important
features:

   * it should run happily without root (on a non-root port)

   * it should be a regular android app requiring no special permissions,
     and not requiring any 'magic' executable files

   * should not rely on busybox

   * preferably support sftp

   * open source

The existing apps are either expensive, don't work, need root, or too
complicated, or a mix of all of the above.  And none of them are open
source.

I figure I'll start with dropbear, which I will run through JNI instead
of putting it in its own binary (because making such a binary executable
is a bit of a hack).

So that's the plan........
